'ExTra - Expense Tracker' will allow us to view the things we spend the most money on. It will detect the user’s spending patterns. It can also detect some unnecessary expenses (such as street food). Thus, it may help to cut down such expenses thereby, helping us to save money.

Features:
1. Ability to input the daily expenses and select from the available categories on which the user has spent his money.
2. User can add various tags on each expense so that he may analyse the transactions by tags.
3. The user can view his daily, monthly and yearly expenses and also view expenses by category.
4. Also, the user can set a predefined budget limit so that he can be warned when he is close to the limit or crosses the limit.

So, the main screens of the app will consist of the following:
1. View previously added expenses
2. Add new expense with its amount, category and tags
3. View analytics of user’s various expenses in the form of bar graphs and pie charts.
